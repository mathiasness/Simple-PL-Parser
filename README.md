   - https://nodejs.org/en/download
3. Open project folder in VScode
4. Run command `npm i`
5. To run the project, execute command `npm run start`

If you have any problems with this, please contact a group leader during group session or on Discord.

## Tips

For developing this, you should probably temporarily comment out the entirety of the "EvaluateVistor" and "TypeCheckVisitor", just so it is possible to work on the parser and you don't get too many errors :) 

Don't forget to use the group sessions if you have any issues.
